## File size guidelines

- Keep source files at or below 600 lines.
- If a file grows beyond 600 lines, refactor it by splitting it into smaller, focused modules before adding more changes.
- Preserve existing behavior and public APIs when refactoring; prefer moving cohesive sections into new files in the same folder.
